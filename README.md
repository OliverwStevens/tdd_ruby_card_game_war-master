# tdd_ruby_card_game_war

This is a starter repository for programmers new to TDD, objects, and/or ruby.

The first assignment is to create a test-driven version of the card game of war.
The tests for the 4 classes identified by the spec files should all pass by running
```
rspec
```
_NOTE: it starts with one passing and one failing test_

AND

The manual system test
```
ruby lib/war_runner.rb
```
produces something like:
```
[… lots of stuff deleted …]
Player 2 took 4 of ♥ with 10 of ♠
Player 1 took 7 of ♠ with K of ♥
Player 1 took 4 of ♥, 10 of ♥, 10 of ♠ with K of ♥ after a single tie
Winner: Player 1
```

Later assignments may add other interfaces to the game.
